CSS files, also known as cascading style sheets, contain coding elements that describe how HTML elements should appear on screen, on paper, or in other media. CSS allows for the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation makes it possible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice, and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific examples.</p>
